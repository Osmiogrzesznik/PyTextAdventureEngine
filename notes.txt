# you are bieng hunted / chased , there is a bike and road to escape. If you dont take the bike , hunter gets you 
# for async user interface refisters observer and has 
def setUserInputString()
that inturn notufies observers of change 
user interface registers inpout for example websocket or some request
everytime this reqyest comes it calls setUserInputString with value from async input  event
if blocking standard input is your input then sending string to in out module immediately calls the method with the outcome
this requires inout module to be independent and use separat print and input ,ethods 

#think about cases where names could be two words 'rusty sword' 'spell book'

#using lamp is distributing loght to adjoining rooms

    # if tool for playing action castle:
        cool if players have weird ideas option to add to room description
        by entering add: pillow is now torn apart you modify the description permanently
        
    # there should be check canDescribe, some rooms having state - too dark to read and so on
    
    DECOUPLING FROM BLOCKING INPUT TEXT INTERFACE to make asynchronous:
        keep loop on hold till user input comes
        do not use loop, instead keep state waitingForUserInput

    # what else could be dependent on the map data (JSON LIKE)
        - verbs for examine, go , look , use, open and so on

    # apart from json like map - you can provide custom functions 
    that accept current room, player, state and what not
     as parameter - check if it is possible to store function in dict 
     or user has to put them in object or name specifically

ideas:
    APEIRON LIKE:
    - ground, mechanics, and code breaking user can creat his own rooms, items?
    - travelling by looking, (look verb could be a door-like mechanism)
    
    OTHER:
    { CAN GO TOGETHER
    - Nemesis monster
        needs time variable and simple AI, somebody following your steps,
        and maybe is able to leave footprints (affecting each room state)

    - Time travel:
        an orthogonal dimension to travel, but changing things in the past changes future
        you cannot meet yourself, this could be the main NEMESIS plot, nemesis is you
            you need to store every command written and replay it
        poblem how to build game in such a way simple , that 
        how to connect the state of two rooms such that time travel is possible
    }

    - talk to schizophrenic voice in your head, that knows more than you/

    - Schizophrenic VOICE:
        YOU ARE SCHIZOPHRENIC VOICE, and character sometimes does 
        not do what you command. 
        Voice - YOu is time traveller, and doesnt know why but knows about guards placement
        every time you die you start anew - and you hear your past voices telling you what to do.

    - Hunters, Nemesis are entity that moves across rooms independently, tracking player . Player leaves marks like foot prints, and they
     know where he is. He can hide but some actions may reveal him. depending where they are.
    On each move of the player their object gets updated.
